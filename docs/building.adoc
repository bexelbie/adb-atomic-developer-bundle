Building the ADB Vagrant Box
----------------------------

The Vagrant box is based on CentOS7. It is built using the latest
packages from CentOS core. Some components of the ADB will be delivered
in containers and will use code drawn from upstream projects to add
newer features. Today no containers are including a fully built box. The
box can be built using the CentOS powered
https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CommunityBuildSystem[Community Build
System (CBS)]

To build the box:

* Get access for building images in the CBS by following the directions
here: http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CommunityBuildSystem
+
*Note:* You need to request both "build" and "image" permissions
* Checkout/git clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle`
* `cd adb-atomic-developer-bundle`
* Run the `./build_tools/build_scripts/do_vagrant_cbs.sh`
+
*Note:* This script assumes you have a profile in your
$HOME/.koji/config called "cbs" If this is your only usage of koji,
delete the `-p cbs` from the command in the script. If you use multiple
instances of koji, either rename your config for the CBS or change the
script.

Here is an example koji scratch build:
