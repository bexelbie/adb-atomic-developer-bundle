Installing the Atomic Developer Bundle
--------------------------------------

[[install-a-virtualization-provider]]
1. Install a Virtualization Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two virtualization providers have been tested with the ADB.

* Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X
+
The suggested virtualization provider is
https://www.virtualbox.org[VirtualBox]. Installation instructions are
available https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html[online]. While the
latest stable shipping release should work, the majority of testing has
been done with version 5.0.0 on Mac OS X and 5.0.8 on Microsoft Windows.

* Fedora
+
Two different virtualization providers are supported on Linux,
https://www.virtualbox.org[VirtualBox] and http://libvirt.org/[libvirt].
The choice as to which to use should be driven by your preferences and
environmental concerns and is outside of the scope of this document.
Both will work equally well in their default configuration. You may wish
to read the section on file synchronization when making this decision.
+
** VirtualBox installation instructions are available
https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html#startingvboxonlinux[online
at the VirtualBox website]. Testing has been done with versions 4.3.34
and 5.0.0.
+
A summary of the installation is listed below:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo dnf -y install dkms
$ curl -O http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/fedora/virtualbox.repo
$ sudo mv virtualbox.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
$ sudo dnf -y install VirtualBox-4.3
$ sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
While the latest stable release should work, the majority of testing has
been done with version 4.3.30.

** Installing libvirt dependencies can be skipped as they are
automatically installed together with `vagrant-libvirt` package.
+
Testing has been done with libvirt version 1.2.18 and vagrant-libvirt
versions through to 0.0.32.

* CentOS

https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Virtualization/VirtualBox[CentOS specific
instructions] are also available.
+
While the latest stable release should work, the majority of testing has
been done with version 4.3.30.
+
A summary of the installation is listed below:
+
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo yum -y install epel-release
$ sudo yum -y install dkms
$ curl -O http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/rhel/virtualbox.repo
$ sudo mv virtualbox.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
$ sudo yum -y install VirtualBox-4.3
$ sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

** Installing libvirt dependencies can be skipped as they are
automatically installed together with `vagrant-libvirt` package.
+
Testing has been done with libvirt version 1.2.18 and vagrant-libvirt
versions through to 0.0.32.

[[install-vagrant]]
2. Install Vagrant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Microsoft Windows
1.  Follow the directions at
https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html[vagrantup.com]
Testing has been done with version 1.7.4.
2.  Install an `ssh` client. Two good options are:
** https://cygwin.com/install.html[Cygwin]
** http://www.mingw.org/[mingw]
** Putty is not recommended as it doesn't currently interface with
Vagrant
* Mac OS X
+
Follow the directions at
https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html[vagrantup.com]
Testing has been done with version 1.7.4.

* Fedora 22/23/Rawhide(24)
+
Testing has been done with version 1.7.2.

** To install Vagrant with VirtualBox in Fedora 22/23/24 (Rawhide):
+
-----------------------------
$ sudo dnf install -y vagrant
-----------------------------

** To install Vagrant with libvirt in Fedora 22/23/24 (Rawhide):
+
----------------------------------------------------
$ sudo dnf -y install vagrant-libvirt

# Start libvirtd
$ sudo systemctl start libvirtd

# Set libvirtd to start automatically on system boot
$ sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
----------------------------------------------------

* CentOS
+
Vagrant packages are not available directly in CentOS core. However they
are available through official CentOS
http://softwarecollections.org[Software Collections] builds.
+
Here are the commands to get Vagrant in CentOS with libvirt support:
+
----------------------------------------------------
$ sudo yum -y install centos-release-scl
$ sudo yum -y install sclo-vagrant1
$ sudo scl enable sclo-vagrant1 bash

# Start libvirtd
$ sudo systemctl start libvirtd

# Set libvirtd to start automatically on system boot
$ sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
----------------------------------------------------

[[download-the-adb]]
3. Download the ADB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to download the ADB. You can have `vagrant` do it for
you the first time you install it or you can download it manually.

* `vagrant` Initiated Download
+
The image is available at
https://atlas.hashicorp.com/projectatomic/boxes/adb. The `vagrant`
program is capable of downloading the box the first time it is needed.
This happens when you first initialize a new vagrant environment.
+
If you wish to use a project provided vagrant file you should first get
the Vagrantfile as directed in link:using.rst[Using the Atomic Developer
Bundle] in the _Using Custom Vagrantfiles for Specific Use Cases_
section.
+
Otherwise you can issue a `vagrant init` command per the below. You may
wish to review the link:using.rst[Using the Atomic Developer Bundle]
documentation before starting the ADB, especially if you are using
host-based tools.
+
--------------------------------
# Add the image to vagrant
$ vagrant init projectatomic/adb
--------------------------------
* Manually Downloading the Vagrant Box Image
+
Alternatively, you can manually download the vagrant box from
http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/[cloud.centos.org] using
your web browser or curl. For example:
+
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To get the libvirt image
$ wget http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/AtomicDeveloperBundle-<latest>.box

# To get the virtual box image
$ wget http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/AtomicDeveloperBundle-<latest>.box
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Once you have downloaded the image, you can add it to `vagrant` with
this command:
+
---------------------------------------------------------
# Add the image to vagrant
$ vagrant box add adb <local path to the downloded image>
---------------------------------------------------------

At this point your Atomic Developer Bundle installation is complete. You
can find link:using.rst[Usage Information] in the documentation
directory.
