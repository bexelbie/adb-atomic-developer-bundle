Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* All changes should be made by pull request (PR), even from core
committers/maintainers.
* All changes need 2 ACKs from maintainers before they will be approved
for inclusion. If the author of the PR is a maintainer, the submission
is considered 1 of the 2 ACKs. Therefore PRs from maintainers only
require one additional ACK. By "2 ACKs" we mean that 2 maintainers must
acknowledge that the change is a good one. The 2nd person to ACK the PR
should merge the PR with a comment including their agreement.
